Hey guys!

I just started learning HTML, CSS, JS about 2 months ago, and im still currently learning.
So thats my first real project, and i decided to make this todo list with things ive learned so far :D

I hope you like it!


-----------------HOW TO USE:

Very simple :) just open  "index.html" and start recording your daily tasks :D




-----------------PROJECT STATUS:
- 90% of this project are done, just minor stuff to chance.


----------------- WHAT IM USING ON THIS PROJECT:

Basically i used DOM and vanilla javascript to manipulate and create the main HTML elements, like buttons, lists, divs and stuff.
Never forget there are so many ways to do a to do list or other projects, and you have to use what you feel most confortable using (:
