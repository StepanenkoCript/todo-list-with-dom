-------------UPDATE:------------- 
Now your favorite todo list is even better! :D
Using local storage and calendar input, you can write down your tasks by the date and time, and they will be saved, even if you close the browser or press F5! ;)
Try it!


Hey guys!

I just started learning HTML, CSS, JS about 2 months ago, and im still currently learning.
So thats my first real project, and i decided to make this todo list with things ive learned so far :D

I hope you like it!


-----------------HOW TO USE:

Very simple :) just open  "index.html" and start recording your daily tasks :D
Or you can enter here: https://stepanenkocript.github.io/todo-list-with-dom/




-----------------PROJECT STATUS:
- 90% of this project are done, just minor stuff to change.




----------------- WHAT IM USING ON THIS PROJECT:

Basically i used DOM and vanilla javascript to manipulate and create the main HTML elements, like buttons, lists, divs and stuff.
Never forget there are so many ways to do a to do list or other projects, and you have to use what you feel most confortable using (:
